# TeamStyleGuide_COSC-1337_ACC

Group assignment in which our group decides on a programming style each individual must follow.
This allows for the program to be uniform, readable, and more cohesive when edited by multiple people.

This repository is a way to edit a common document which, upon completion, will be cloned by each individual
that is a part of this group and submitted individually in their own course homework repositories.

The assignment is considered complete when each individual in the group submits their own copy of this collectively
edited document.
